## About pcaExplorer

`pcaExplorer` is a Bioconductor package containing a Shiny application for
analyzing expression data in different conditions and experimental factors. 

`pcaExplorer` guides the user in exploring the Principal Components of the data, 
providing tools and functionality to detect outlier samples, genes that show 
particular patterns, and additionally provides a functional interpretation of 
the principal components for further quality assessment and hypothesis generation
on the input data. 

Thanks to its interactive/reactive design, it is designed to become a practical
companion to any RNA-seq dataset analysis, making exploratory data analysis 
accessible also to the bench biologist, while providing additional insight also
for the experienced data analyst.

`pcaExplorer` was developed in the Bioinformatics Division led by Harald Binder 
at the IMBEI (Institut f√ºr Medizinische Biometrie, Epidemiologie und Informatik) 
in the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.
